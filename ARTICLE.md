Here is an article regarding how AI isn't ready to code by itself just yet:
[Why AI Isn’t Ready to Be a Real Coder](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-for-coding)

This article links to a recent research paper that claim that although avoiding AI in any case when coding can nowadays be seen as primitive, relying too much on it could actually make coding harder than if a human were to just code a section or program by himself or herself.

For example, software engineers may look into multiple sections of the code to find an error in which the program crashes in a code section far away from where the error is found. AI commonly struggles with this and would hallucinate to claim the sections of code that once executed result in a crash but are NOT the cause of the crash are the code lines causing the crash. Another notable section in this article describes how giving a prompt to a large-language model to generate a code and readjusting that prompt again and again can take longer than just having a human write the code itself. This dichotomy between what the program is supposed to do and what the program is actually doing is more well-suited for human software engineers than AI tools.

Comment on the Article:

I found the following article very interesting and insightful. The paper highlights that AI cannot completely replace developers. However, relying entirely on AI can backfire, as it may introduce subtle errors across different parts of a system. Fixing these issues can often take more time than if the developer had written the code themselves.

The main takeaway I got is that while AI can be a helpful tool for coding small parts and functions, it still cannot replace humans. Large codebases still do require human judgment.
